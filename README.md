# Intruduction
In this video series we are going to see how to configure SQL Server 2019 Active / Active Cluster. Following are the pre-requisit for that

## Softwares needed
1. Windows Server 2019 Evaluation Edition, which you can download from 
    https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2019
2. Vritualization Software - You can download VMWare Workstattion for free from following link for non-prod environment 
    https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html


# Configuring Windows Server Cluster
Very first step in configuring SQL Server 2019 cluster is to have Windows Cluster first. Now there are many steps involved while creating Windows Cluster itself. Following are the steps which you can follow in-order to configure Windows Server Cluster

## 1. Installation of Windows Server 2019 Server
1. Install Windows Server 2019 by creating a Virtual Machine
2. Change machine name 
3. Allocate IP Address 
   #### Computer Name 
        1. This PC --> Properties --> Advanced System Settings --> Computer Name (gogate-dc-1)
   #### IP Addresses
        1. Control Panel --> Network & Internet --> Network and Sharing Center --> Ethernet0 --> Properties --> Internet Protocol Verstion 4 --> (TCP/IPv4)
           - Static IP Address : 192.168.80.10 (https://www.paessler.com/it-explained/ip-address) & (https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-decimal.html)
           - Subnet Mask : 255.255.255.0 (https://www.paessler.com/it-explained/ip-address)
           - Default Gateway : 192.168.80.2 [Same for all VMs] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_gateway)
           - Preferred DNS Server : 192.168.80.10 [Same for all VMs] (https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-a-dns-server/)
           - Alternet DNS Server : 192.168.80.2 
   #### Disable Firewall
        1. Control Panel --> System and Security --> Windows Defender Firewall --> Turn Off Windows Defender Firewall
## 2. Domain Controller Configurations   
### Installation of Active Directory
    1. Open Server Manager
    2. Local Server --> Manage --> Add Roles & Features
    3. Installation Type --> Role Based Installation
    4. Select local server - this is a default option
    5. Server Roles --> Select - Active Directory Domain Services 
    6. Install
### Configuring Active Directory Domain Service
    1. Click on AD-DS Role at Server Manager
    2. Click More
    3. Select Action - Promote server to domain controller
    4. Add a new forest (Since we don't have any existing domain)
    5. Give domain name as - gogates.local [you can give any name which you want eg. abc.xyz.pqr]
    6. Click Next
    7. Specify DSRM (directory service recovery mode) password
    8. No need to create DNS deligation
    9. NetBIOS domain name -- keep it default (it will appear as gogates as we had mentioned domain as gogates.local)
    10. Paths - Keep it default
    11. Install
    12. Restart & Login with Doamin User this time
### Validating Active Directory 
    1. Open "Active Directory Users and Computers"

## 3. Installation of 2 Nodes
### Installation of node-1
1. Install Windows Server 2019 by creating a Virtual Machine
2. Change machine name 
3. Allocate IP Address
   #### Computer Name 
        1. This PC --> Properties --> Advanced System Settings --> Computer Name (gogate-node-1)
   #### IP Addresses
        1. Control Panel --> Network & Internet --> Network and Sharing Center --> Ethernet0 --> Properties --> Internet Protocol Verstion 4 --> (TCP/IPv4)
           - Static IP Address : 192.168.80.15 (https://www.paessler.com/it-explained/ip-address) & (https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-decimal.html)

           - Alternet DNS Server : Keep blank
   #### Disable Firewall
        1. Control Panel --> System and Security --> Windows Defender Firewall --> Turn Off Windows Defender Firewall

## 4. Adding nodes to Domain
1. Validate if you can ping to Domain from both the nodes - ping gogates.local
2. Assign domain name for both nodes 
   - This PC --> Properties --> Advanced System Settings --> Member Of Domain - gogates.local
   - Specify credentials for Domain Admin - gogates\Administrator & P@ssword#123
   - Restart server
   - Follow same steps for both nodes
   - While logging you should be able to login as Domain Administrator user instead of local Administrator
   - Validate nodes in Domain Controller using "Active Directory Users and Computers"

## 5. Installation of iScassi Target
As mentioned in very first video and also in image, DC Server / Node will also act as Storage or SAN. We will create 6 drives there as below
1. 2 Data Drives (5 GB Each) - Data01 (G) & Data02 (H)
2. 2 Log Drives (3 GB Each) - Log01 (L) & Log02 (M)
3. 2 Temp Drives (2 GB Each) - Temp01 (T) & Temp02 (U)
4. Quorum Drive (1 GB)

These drives will share with other nodes, wherein we will actually install & configure SQL Server 2019 Active \ Active Cluster.

Now, in order to create & share \ present these drives (iscasi luns) to other nodes, we need to follow following steps
### a. Installation of iSCSI Target Server
        1. Open Server Manager
        2. Local Server --> Manage --> Add Roles & Features

    2. Next --> select quorum witness
    3. Configure a disk witness
    4. Select witness disk (Q) from available disk
### e. Validate Cluster Failover    

## 7. SQL Server 2019 Installation - Prerequisite

### a. Creating Service Accounts
    1. Open "Active Directory Users and Computers"
    2. Create AD Group "SQL PRD ADMIN" for all Admins, and give Domain Admin or Local Admin access to this group.
    3. Add individual Domain Accounts to "SQL PROD ADMIN". e.g. Add gogates\magogate or gogates\dgogate to group "SQL PRD ADMIN"
    4. Make AD Group "SQL PRD ADMIN" as a Local Admin to each node
       - Open "Edit Local Users and Groups"
       - Under Groups section, select "Administrator" group and add "SQL PRD ADMIN" in it.
    5. Create separate Service Accounts for each SQL Service as below
       - SQL.PRD.SERVER
       - SQL.PRD.AGENT   
       
### b. Grant Windows Rights to SQL Server Service account
    1. Open "Local Group Policy Editor"
    2. Add above listed SA accounts to following listing - https://www.sqlshack.com/perform-volume-maintenance-tasks-security-policy/
       - Perform volume maintenance tasks
       - Lock pages in memory

### c. Benchmarking LUNs or Speed Checks of Shared Drives
    1. Download & Install "Crystal Disk" software from https://osdn.net/projects/crystaldiskmark/downloads/71859/CrystalDiskMark7_0_0h.exe/
    2. How to read "Crystal Disk" results - https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2012/03/how-fast-your-san-or-how-slow/
    3. Use Microsoft DiskSpd from - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/manage/diskspd-overview

### d. Changing to CSVFS (Cluster Shared Volume File System) format
    1. Sharing Disks between 2 nodes
       - Open Administrative Tools --> Failover Cluster Manager
       - Create 2 Empty Roles - Node1 & Node2
       - Assign Preferred Owner as Node1, Node2 & vice versa       
       - Assign Storage to each node
    3. or instead use CSVFS - Why its needed?
    4. More information on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/failover-clustering/failover-cluster-csvs

    10. Specify Data Directories     
       - Select data root directory as "C:\ClusterStorage\Volume1\MSSQL\Data01"
       - Select User database directory as "C:\ClusterStorage\Volume1\MSSQL\Data01\MSSQL15.DGOGATE\MSSQL\Data"
       - Select User database log directory as "C:\ClusterStorage\Volume3\MSSQL\Log01\MSSQL15.DGOGATE\MSSQL\Data"
    11. Temp DB
        - As per microsoft documentation "The number of secondary data files depends on the number of (logical) processors on the machine. As a general rule, if the number of logical processors is less than or equal to eight, use the same number of data files as logical processors. If the number of logical processors is greater than eight, use eight data files. Then if contention continues, increase the number of data files by multiples of four until the contention decreases to acceptable levels, or make changes to the workload/code." which is available as below
        - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/databases/tempdb-database?view=sql-server-ver15
        - Since in our case - logical processors are 2, SQL installer intelligently took "No. of Files" as 2        
        - What Size you would select? check that at https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2016/01/cheat-sheet-how-to-configure-tempdb-for-microsoft-sql-server/
        - Since we are going to have 3 GB of Temp drive for each node, select "Initial Size (MB)" as 1 GB (1024 MB)
        - Select data directory as - C:\ClusterStorage\Volume5\MSSQL\Temp01
        - Select log directory as - C:\ClusterStorage\Volume3\MSSQL\Log01\MSSQL15.DGOGATE\MSSQL\Data
        - Keep "Temp log file Size configuration" as default
    12. MaxDOP
        - Total no of logical processors we have are 2 so based on that it got selected as 2 by default. Please see documentation as below
        - https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/6211/sql-server-2019-installation-enhancements-for-maxdop-and-max-memory/
    13. Memory
        - Click on "Recommended"
        - Since we have total 2 GB avilable for VM, change max memory to 1024 MB / 1 GB
        - Select "Click here to accept the recommended memory configurations for the SQL Server Database Engine"
        - More information is available at https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/6211/sql-server-2019-installation-enhancements-for-maxdop-and-max-memory/
    14. FileStream
        - This is required if you are going to use un-structured data. we will ignore this
        - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/blob/filestream-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15
    15. Click Next & the Install
    16. Installation will fail with error as below if you specify Temp directory directly as C:\ClusterStorage\Volume3. So, make sure you will create directory inside a drive before installation
        "Updating permission settings for folder "C:\ClusterStorage\Volume3" failed. Please check blog - https://blog.sqlauthority.com/2017/11/11/sql-server-installation-error-updating-permission-setting-file-failed/
    17. Cancel installation, create a new directory under Volume3 and re-start installation
